            <section>
                <p><b>The Music Study</b> is a family run music education studio, owned and operated by Vanessa and Jason Benoit, musicians and music educators for over 15 years. After spending many years teaching in other cities and working for other schools, we are pleased and excited to use all of our teaching and school administration experience to offer our home neighborhood of Alvinston and surrounding area a better music school experience, with a consistent format for private music lessons, and a wonderful group program for early learners! We are lovers of music in every style and form and want to help you develop the skills you need to play whatever kind of music you love. We are… </p>

                <h2>Vanessa (Voice / Piano / Early Childhood Music / Songwriting / Composition)</h2>
                <p>Vanessa  is in love with music.  She started playing piano when she was four and worked her way to grade 10 RCM.  Searching for wider experience, she travelled to India where she became fascinated with classical tabla playing and studied tabla intently both there and back in Vancouver.  Although she had always secretly wanted to, she began singing seriously in her early twenties, completing an honours BFA in vocal jazz and improvisation at York University in 2004. She has been teaching voice and piano for over 15 years—tailoring lessons to her students individual needs and interests while weaving in improvisation and composition as important ways of developing musicianship and a personal connection to music.  As a musician she has toured in Canada and across the U.S., released five albums, written over a hundred songs, enjoyed some radio play, and played in a variety of styles with some wonderful musicians.</p>

                <h2>Jason (Guitar / Banjo / Songwriting)</h2>
                <p>Jason has spent most of his life involved in music, having given his first vocal performance for an audience at age 6 — in the role of Santa Claus! With 20 years of experience playing the guitar, 12 years playing the banjo, and 10 years teaching music, he is thrilled to share his knowledge, wisdom, and talents with learners of all ages, while keeping the learning process fun and engaging. He still performs regularly as a professional musician, and continues to compose original music and to bring his fresh approach to musical projects in which he is involved. In addition to his musical skills, Jason’s love of people and administrative experience are an asset to The Music Study team in his role as studio administrator. <a href="contact.html">Talk to him today</a> to book your free trial lesson — he’s waiting to hear from you!</p>
